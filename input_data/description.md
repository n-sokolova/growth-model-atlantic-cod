# SODA data (1980-1989)

The repository contains an example dataset from the [Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA)](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/soda-simple-ocean-data-assimilation) retrospective analysis data set (Carton et al., 2000; Carton and Giese, 2008). The example SODA dataset provides 10 years of temperature data from 1980 to 1989 with monthly resolution. The dataset contains spatial data on a regular lon-lat grid (0.5°x0.5° horizontal resolution) for the North Atlantic. We extracted temperature data for 0–580 m (0–21 vertical levels) which represent the observed depth range of cod distribution (Cohen et al., 1990). The areas with depths below 600m were blanked out.

All files are in the [NetCDF format](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/).
